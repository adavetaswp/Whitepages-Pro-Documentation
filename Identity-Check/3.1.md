# Identity Check API

Overview

Verify customer identities, screen applications for fraud, and assess the risk of a transaction. Whitepages Pro Identity Check is the only 5-query-in-1 identity verification solution on the market. In addition to providing rich data about each input, Identity Check performs the following cross-verifications:

1. email-to-name
2. phone-to-name
3. phone-to-address
4. address-to-name
5. IP geolocation-to-address
6. IP geolocation-to-phone


## Request
The Identity Check API can field up to two sets of inputs. You should submit specific parameters based on the amount of data you want to validate.
If you have one set of inputs:

* name
* phone
* address.street_line_1
* address.street_line_2 (optional, can include this as part of street_line_1)
* address.city
* address.state_code
* address.postal_code
* address.country_code
* email_address
* ip_address
* api_key (required)

A well-formatted request with one set of inputs looks like:

```
https://proapi.whitepages.com/3.1/identity_check?address.city=Ashland&address.country_code=US&address.postal_code=59004&address.state_code=MT&address.street_line_1=302+Gorham+Ave&name=Drama+Number&phone=6464806649&email_address=medjalloh1@yahoo.com&ip_address=64.124.61.215&api_key=API_KEY

**Phone Checks**

Includes phone_checks, billing_phone_checks, and shipping_phone_checks. These components indicate whether the phone is valid, provides metadata attributes, and verifies if the phone subscriber name matches the input name provided and if the phone location matches the input address provided.

Inputs considered: billing/shipping phone, billing/shipping address, and billing/shipping name


| Field     | Type | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ---- |
| error | Object | Object contains 2 strings. message and name.

| phone_to_name | String | Verification result whether the subscriber name for the phone matches the input name. Possible values: Match, No match, No name found, null. A match is a positive indicator and should allow clearing the transactions when used in conjunction with other signals. A no match is a modest risk indicator. Additional testing needed for specific customer scenario to assign appropriate weighting. |
| phone_to_address | String | Verification result whether the address associated with the phone matches the input address. Possible values: Match, Postal match, Zip+4 match, City/State match, No match, null. A match are positive indicators and should allow clearing the transactions when used in conjunction with other signals. A no match is a modest risk indicator, but also can be result of family plans or phones belonging to a business. |
| subscriber_name | String | Subscriber name of the input phone. |
| is_subscriber_deceased | Boolean | Indicates if the subscriber associated with the phone is deceased. True is a risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for manual review. |

Non-Fixed VOIP, Tollfree number is a risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for further review |
| carrier | String | The company that provides voice and/or data services for this phone number. Carriers are returned at the MVNO level. Certain carriers correlate well as a potential risk signal. Please contact us APISupport@whitepages.com to learn more. |

| registered_name | String | Returns the name that we have on record for the supplied email. |
| email_first_seen_date | Date | Date when the email was first seen. The earlier the email seen date is, the better signal of the transaction being good when used in conjunction with other signals. null means email was never seen before |
| email_first_seen_days | Integer | Days since when the email was first seen. The greater the number of days, the better the signal of the transaction being good when used in conjunction with other signals. Typical buckets during risk analysis are: New (< 90 days), Established (Between 90 and 720 days), Well Established (Over 720 days). New bucket is a potential risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for further review |
| email_domain_creation_date | Date | Date when the email domain was created. The earlier the email domain creation date is, the better signal of the transaction being good when used in conjunction with other signals. |
| email_domain_creation_days | Integer | Days since when the email domain was created. The greater the number of days, the better the signal of the transaction being good when used in conjunction with other signals. Typically an email where the domain has been created less than 30 days ago is a risk indicator and the transaction should be flagged for further review |
